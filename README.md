# Project-Based-Intern-Muamalat

During my participation in the Virtual Internship Experience with Bank Muamalat from Rakamin Academy, I have completed a Final Project as a Business Intelligence Analyst. In this project, I conducted an analysis of sales performance using SQL to extract data, visualize it, and create a dashboard. The project includes a detailed examination of sales data and insights into trends and patterns in customer behavior. The resulting dashboard provides a clear picture of sales performance and enables informed decision-making to improve sales outcomes. Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to apply SQL skills to real-world business problems and produce actionable insights to drive business growth.
